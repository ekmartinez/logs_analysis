# Logs Analysis

This repository contains computer logs and other evidence that are been kept here for future analysis.  

**For what purpose?**

Because some suspicious activity has been detected on my personal HP laptop (https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06085994).


**Events**

While testing out OpenSuse Tumbleweed on the machine I noticed that the laptop was turned on while I was sleeping (apx 3:50 AM). At first I thought that some bad actor had gained physical access to my room while I was sleeping, but the next day I took extra measures to make sure no one would enter the room, to my surprise the suspicious activity happened again.  It seems there is process programmed to turn on the system at certain hour without interaction from the user.

Since the OS was freshed installed it was not possible for it to have some kind of malware, so I turned my attention to flashing the bios with the latests firmware, then I did a fresh install of a dual boot setup with with Linux and Windows, but I just keeps happening.  Which takes me to my next theory, some malicious hardware embedded into the motherbord.

Haven't been able to confirm this theory because the case seems to be sealed in such a way that is nearly imposible to open it without breaking it.  In the meantime we will continue to gather,  analyze and investigate the issue further.
